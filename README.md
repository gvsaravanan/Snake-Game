 - ### Stores data of user's scores
 
 During each game, the user's score will be displayed in the upper right corner and updates as the snake eats more pellets.
 After the game is over, an alert will pop up displaying the user's game score as well as the user's highest score.
 The alert will also ask if the user wishes to continue playing or wishes to exit the app.
